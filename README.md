## 🎯 Project Overview

Our mission? Train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify sports images using the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidharkal/sports-image-classification/data).  
We handled everything from data wrangling to hyperparameter tuning—with a lot of patience, and TensorBoard plots.

## 🧼 Part I: Data Preparation

✔ Downloaded and loaded the sports image dataset  
✔ Cleaned missing and duplicate entries  
✔ Visualized class distribution & image samples  
✔ Checked correlations and balance  
✔ Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization)  
✔ Encoded labels  
✔ Split data (80% training / 20% testing)

## 🧠 Part II: CNN Model Training

Our CNN model includes:
- Multiple convolutional layers
- Batch normalization
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully connected layers
- Softmax output

We explored:
- 🧪 Batch sizes: 32, 64  
- 🧪 Different dropout rates  
- 🧪 Optimizers: Adam, SGD, RMSProp  
- 🧪 Regularization (L2 weight decay)  
- 🧪 Learning rates & LR schedulers

TensorBoard was used for real-time training monitoring!
